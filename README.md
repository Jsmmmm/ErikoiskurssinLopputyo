This is java desktop application that works as bookkeeping software for tournament kind of competitions with different kinds of sports and competitors. Idea is to practice how to create a traditional tool-like software that use different controls : border pane that has toolbar on top, treeview on left, listview at bottom and tabpane in the middle by using JavaFX. Attention were also paid on how to create, load and save state of the data, in this example: a tournament with competitors, teams, sports/events and their series, scoreboards etc. The idea is from programming course of Vaasa University. The application is not ready yet.
