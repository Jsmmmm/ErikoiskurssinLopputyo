This is a java desktop application that works as bookkeeping software for tournament kind of competitions with different kinds of sports and competitors. The idea is to practice how to create a traditional tool-like software that uses different controls: a border pane that has a toolbar on the top, treeview on the left, listview at the bottom and tabpane in the middle by using JavaFX. Attention was also paid to how to create, load and save the state of the data, in this example: a tournament with competitors, teams, sports/events and their series, scoreboards etc. The idea is from a programming course of Vaasa University. The application is not ready yet.
